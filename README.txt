14:00: Made the site public on github and tested on all three computers(team members) together.
14:30: Got the students free plan on Azure and tried to upload the site as a web app
14:50: Made it work gammaweargammawear.azurewebsites.net except the home page.
14:50: Site worked fine when tried to login, create user and even on about page but main/home page did not work.
15:10: Tried to update site using different creds such as my computer but my team mate's github(primary repo) but the same error at the end.

15:15: Dropped the idea of creating it on azure wasn't mandatory but preferred for this assignment(at least for now)

15:20 edited the edit.cshtml file and add some more socks images to the app.. error loading created another folder git.cshtl with the same content 
runtime error on all 3 computers, that means the problem seemed to be in the code .. had to delelte and recreate some of the file. such as cshmtl files

15:25 Synced the files and the site worked now on the local host 
It still didnnt work on other computers, had to update the database and performed the sync again using nutget packet manager

15:28 issues sorted out on all computers.
